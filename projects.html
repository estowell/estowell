            <p> Churches play a major role in providing social support to address health inequities within various communities in United States, in part by connecting church members to services. While public health has a history of disseminating interventions in faith communities, little work has explored how technologies can be used to tailor interventions to the unique culture of each church community. Following Community Based Participatory Research principles, we partnered with predominantly African-American churches, to develop and evaluate an mHealth intervention.

            <img class="project-img" src="static/images/MeToo-Blue.png" style ="float: right;" width='200px' margin='4px'>
            <p>Following a tweet from actress Alyssa Milano which called on women to 	share the phrase “me too” if they have
              been sexually harassed or assaulted, thousands of women disclosed experiences of sexual violence, sometimes
              for the first time, through the hashtag #MeToo. To understand the landscape painted by these disclosures and
              the effect of disclosing these experiences publicly, we study the conversational social network that emerged
              around the #MeToo.</p>

            <h3 class="project-heading">mHealth Systematic Review</h3>
            <p>There has been a proliferation of research examining how mobile health (mHealth) applications can encourage
              wellness. A growing focus of this work has been the exploration of how mHealth tools can promote healthy behaviors within
              vulnerable populations. We conducted a systematic review of such research, examining the design and impact
              of mHealth tools for low-socioeconomic individuals and racial/ethnic minority groups. Our findings highlight
              trends that can drive critically needed digital innovations in health promotion for populations that experience
              disproportionate barriers to wellness.</p>

            <p>The number of informal caregivers who are supporting family members with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is
              rising dramatically. These caregivers have numerous mental and physical health problems associated with the
              burdens of care. In this project, we are developing a digital game to increase physical activity and social
              connections for the AD caregivers.</p>

              I collaborated on a project on the development of a smart calendar system to support healthy aging.
              We explored how ambient and adaptive notification can encourage healthy behaviors and support cognitive function.</p>

              I collaborated on a project on visualization of personal genomic data. We explored how next generation
              technology can facilitate the learning of complex scientific concepts. I worked on genome visualization
              and consent form visualization research in collaboration with the Harvard Personal Genome Project.</p>
