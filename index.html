        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. Student at Northeastern in <a href="https://phi.ccs.neu.edu/">Personal Health Informatics</a>, a program in both the Khoury College of Computer Science and the Bouv√© College of Health Sciences. I completed a B.A. in Health and Society (Individual Designed Major) from Wellesley College. I began computer science coursework in my last year at Wellesley College and joined the <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~hcilab/">Human Computer Interaction Laboratory</a> at Wellesley after graduation.</p>
        <p>My research is in the fields of Public Health, Human-Computer Interactio (HCI), and in Personal Health Informatics. I work with Dr. Andrea Parker in the <a href="http://wellness.ccs.neu.edu/">Wellness Technology Lab</a>. 
        I am broadly interested in social determinants of sexual health and mental health, stigmatization of disease, global health and community development, and health activism. I am exploring how social media data can be used in identifying and addressing health disparities in sexual and mental health.</p>
