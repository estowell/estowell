        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. Student at Northeastern in <a href="https://phi.ccs.neu.edu/">Personal Health Informatics</a>, a program in both the Khoury College of Computer Science and the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. I work with Dr. Andrea Parker in the <a href="http://wellness.ccs.neu.edu/">Wellness Technology Lab. </a> My research is in the fields of Public Health, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and in Personal Health Informatics. I am broadly interested in social determinants of sexual health and mental health, stigmatization of disease, global health and community development, and health activism. I am exploring how social media data can be used in identifying and addressing health disparities in sexual and mental health.</p>
        <p>Prior to joining the Wellness Technology Lab, I completed a B.A. in Health and Society (Individual Designed Major) from Wellesley College. I began computer science coursework in my last year of undergrad, and joined the <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~hcilab/">Human Computer Interaction Laboratory</a> at Wellesley after graduation.</p>

            <h3 class="project-heading">Health Ministry: Smart and Connected Communities</h3>
            <p> Churches play a major role in providing social support to address health inequities within various communities in United States, in part by connecting church members to services. While public health has a history of disseminating interventions in faith communities, little work has explored how technologies can be used to tailor interventions to the unique culture of each church community. Following Community Based Participatory Research principles, we partnered with predominantly African-American churches, to develop and evaluate an mHealth intervention.

            <img class="project-img" src="static/images/MeToo-Blue.png" style ="float: right;" width='200px' margin='4px'>
            <p>Following a tweet from actress Alyssa Milano which called on women to  share the phrase “me too” if they have
              been sexually harassed or assaulted, thousands of women disclosed experiences of sexual violence, sometimes
              for the first time, through the hashtag #MeToo. To understand the landscape painted by these disclosures and
              the effect of disclosing these experiences publicly, we study the conversational social network that emerged
              around the #MeToo.</p>
